# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities **privately**, either via GitHub's
built-in Private Vulnerability Reporting or by email:

**→
[Open a security advisory](https://github.com/andryorelabs/jobship/security/advisories/new)**

**→ Or email [hello@andryore.dev](mailto:hello@andryore.dev)**

Do **not** open a public issue for security reports — that exposes the
vulnerability before a fix is available.

This is a solo-maintained project, so the response times below are targets, not
guarantees.

| Severity | Acknowledge (target) | Patch target |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Critical | 48 h                 | 7 days       |
| High     | 5 days               | 14 days      |
| Medium   | 10 days              | 30 days      |

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is supported. There are no maintained release branches —
a fix lands on `develop` and ships in the next release.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| latest  | ✅        |
| older   | ❌        |

## Credit

Reporters are credited by name (or handle) in the GitHub Security Advisory,
unless you ask to stay anonymous when you report.

## What counts as a vulnerability here

jobship's no-submit rule and the Guard are security boundaries. Report privately anything that lets a Posting, email or web page make jobship submit a form, send a message, bypass the Guard, or leak data from your data dir.
